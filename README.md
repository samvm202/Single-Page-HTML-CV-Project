# Single-Page-HTML-CV-Project
The goal of this project was to make a single cv page with HTML (https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv).
This was my first solo coding project.
I used HTML like required, but also JavaScript and CSS. I wanted a little more dept to the project.
I had a lot of fun with it and am excited for the next project.
